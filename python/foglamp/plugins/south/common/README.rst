Common South Plugin Code
************************

This directory is the location in which code that is common to more than
one South plugin is located. Code here may not be common to all
South plugins, but it should not be specific to an individual
plugin.

Code may be further organised into sub-directories to provide logical
grouping of code with a common purpose.
